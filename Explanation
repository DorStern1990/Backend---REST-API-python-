SafeModePointsRectangle:

This is a REST API as requested.
The controller is implemented in app.py
The services are implemented as a class (services) - each service is a method, which is also responsible for parsing
body json objects if necessary (see API.md for further explanation)

The REST API uses 2 classes:
1. Dict2D (in PointsDict.py):
    It has a dictionary field, that keeps all the points and their keys (key: int, value: tuple of floats)
    Its main use is managing the "insert", "remove", and "get" services.
2. Tree2D (in PointsTree.py):
    It has a KDTree field, that keeps all the points with accordance to the dictionary.
    It is practically updated using the dictionary's data.
    (Note: The tree should reflect the dictionary's data, and not the other way around.)
    Its main use is computing the points in a given rectangle.
    given a center point and a radius, the tree provides us with all the points within a distance as long as radius from
    the center point.

Services complexity:
    insert and remove   - O(N)
    get                 - O(1) in average, O(N) in worst case
    search              - O(sqrt(N) + m) [m being the amount of points that should be returned]
