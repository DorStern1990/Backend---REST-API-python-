# Backend---REST-API-python-
My first REST API !
This Backend part should support:
- Insertion of a 2-dimensional point with float coordinates (and assigning a key to it)
- Removal of a point (by its key)
- Getting a point's coordinates, given its key
- Searching all points within an axis-parallel rectangle (Time complexity - O(sqrt(N)), N being the total amount of points)

Implemented with Flask and json (see requirements.txt)
